    "### 1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Function Application\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate a function application, the interpreter follows the procedure described in section 1.1.4. For primitive functions, this is handled by the interpreter or libraries. For compound functions, the application process is as follows:\n",
    "* To apply a compound function to arguments, evaluate the return expression of the function with each parameter replaced by the corresponding argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply this process to the functions we declared above.  \n",
    "Let's evaluate the application\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "f(5);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `f` is the function we just declared.  \n",
    "We begin by retrieving the return expression of `f`:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "sum_of_squares(a + 1, a * 2);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we replace the parameter `a` with the argument 5:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "sum_of_squares(5 + 1, 5 * 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Thus the problem reduces to the evaluation of an application with two arguments and a function expression `sum_of_squares`. Evaluating this applications involves three subproblems. We continue substituting to reduce these subproblems until we end up with two primitive expressions and a primitive function, an operator applied to them: `36 + 100`. This gives us, finally, `136`."

    "The process we have just described is called the *substitution model* for function application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two points that should be stressed:\n",
    "1. The purpose of the substitution is to help us to think about function application. It is *not* a description of how the interpreter really works: typically interpreters do not evaluate function applications by manipulating the text of the function to substitute values for parameters. In practice, the \"substitution\" is accomplished by using a local environment for the parameters.\n",
    "2. Over the course of this book, we present a sequence of increasingly elaborate models of how interpreters work, culminating with a complete implementation of an interpreter and compiler. The substitution model is only the first of these. When we address the use of functions with mutable data, we will see that the substitution model breaks down and must be replaced by a more complicated model of function evaluation."

    "#### Applicative order versus normal order\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure given in 1.1.4 is not the only way to perform evaluation. An alternative model would not evaluate arguments until their values were needed. Instaed, it would first substitute argument epxressions for parameters until it obtained an expression involving only operators and primitive functions, and would then perform the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used this method, the evaluation of `f(5)` would proceed according to the sequence of expansions\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "sum_of_squares(5 + 1, 5 * 2)\n",

    "6 * 6 + 10 * 10\n",
    "36 + 100\n",
    "136\n",
    "```\n",
    "This gives the same answer as our previous evaluation model, but the process is different. In particular, the evaluations of `5 + 1` and `5 * 2` are each performed twice here, corresponding to the reduction of the expression\n",
    "```javascript\n",

    "sum_of_squares(6, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "square(6) + square(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "and then the reduction would have proceeded as just shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "This alternative method of fully expanding and then reducing is known as *normal-order evaluation*. The interpreter actually evaluates the arguments and then applies functions, and this is called *applicative-order evaluation*. It can be shown that, for function applications that can be modeled using substitution and that yield legitimate values, normal-order and applicative-order evaluation produce the same value. JavaScript uses applicative-order evaluation. This is partly because of the additional efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple evauations of expressions, as just demonstrated. More significantly, normal-order evaluation becomes much more complicated to deal with when we leave the realm of functions that can be modeled by substitution. On the other hand, normal-order evaluation can be an extremely valuable tool."
